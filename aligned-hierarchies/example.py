    Example of full aligned hierarchies pathway
    
    Args
    ----
    file_in: str
        name of .csv file to be processed. Contains features across time steps to be analyzed
        - example-  chroma features
    
    file_out: str
        name of file where output will be stored
    
    num_fv_per_shingle: int
        number of feature vectors per shingle. Provides "context" of each individual
        time step, so that for notes CDE if num_fv_per_shingle = 2 shingles would be CD, DE
        
    thresh: int
        maximum threshold value. Largest length repeated structure to search for.
    
    Returns
    -------
    none: .mat file is saved. Contains variables created for aligned hierarchies.
