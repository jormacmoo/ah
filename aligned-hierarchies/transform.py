transform.py

This script contains functions that take inputs and transform them to be of use in 
bigger functions where they are called. They focus mainly on overlapping
repeated structures and annotation markers.

This file contains the following functions:
    
    * __create_anno_remove_overlaps - Turns rows of repeats into marked rows with 
    annotation markers for the start indices and zeroes otherwise. After 
    removing the annotations that have overlaps, creates separate arrays
    for annotations with overlaps and annotations without overlaps. Finally,
    the annotation markers are checked and fixed if necessary.
    
    * __create_anno_rows - Turns rows of repeats into marked rows with annotation
    markers for start indices and zeroes otherwise. Then checks if the correct 
    annotation markers were given and fixes the markers if necessary.
    
    * remove_overlaps - Removes any pairs of repeats with the same length and 
    annotation marker where at least one pair of repeats overlap in time
    
    * __separate_anno_markers - Expands vector of non-overlapping repeats into
    a matrix representation. The matrix representation is a visual recored of
    where all of the repeats in a song start and end.
